problem 1 :
    Generally it the usage of setTimeOut and setImmidate depends on your scenario 
    you have in you code. BUT we can use setImmmidate for not blocking the 
    event loop where as setTimeOut can be used for controlled delays.

problem 2 :
   process.nextTick() is not part of the event loop and adds the callback 
   into the nextTick queue.But SetImmidate schedules a callback to run
   at check phase of the event loop.

   Use setImmediate if you want to queue the function behind whatever I/O
   event callbacks that are already in the event queue. 
   Use process.nextTick to effectively queue the function at the head of
   the event queue so that it executes immediately after the current 
   function completes.

Problem 3 : 
    fs          timers
    http        url
    https       v8
    os          vm
    assert      Zlib
    stream      readline
